# Fujitsu Mainframe Migration Strategy Framework

Complete framework for planning and executing Fujitsu mainframe migrations to modern platforms.

## 1. Assessment Phase

## 1.1 Inventory Collection

Create comprehensive inventory of all mainframe assets:

**COBOL Programs:**

- Count by type: NetCOBOL, PowerCOBOL, standard COBOL
- Lines of code per program
- Complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity)
- Dependencies (CALL hierarchies)
- Screen programs vs batch programs

**Database Assets:**

- SYMFOWARE databases and schemas
- Table counts and row counts
- Stored procedures and triggers
- Views and indexes
- Transaction volume

**JCL Jobs:**

- Job count and frequency
- Steps per job
- Dependencies between jobs
- Resource requirements
- Schedule information

**File Systems:**

- SAM, PAM, ISAM file usage
- File sizes and volumes
- GDG datasets
- Data retention requirements

**Copybooks and Includes:**

- Shared data structures
- Usage frequency
- Dependencies

### 1.2 Complexity Analysis

**Program Complexity Scoring:**

```
Score = (LOC / 1000) * 0.3 
      + (ExternalCalls * 2) * 0.2
      + (FileOperations * 1.5) * 0.2
      + (SQLStatements * 1) * 0.15
      + (ScreenHandling * 2) * 0.15

Classification:
- Low: Score < 10
- Medium: Score 10-30
- High: Score 30-100
- Very High: Score > 100
```

**Fujitsu-Specific Complexity:**

- NetCOBOL OO features usage
- PowerCOBOL GUI components
- SYMFOWARE-specific SQL
- BS2000/OSD system calls
- Custom Fujitsu extensions

### 1.3 Dependency Analysis

Build complete dependency graph:

- Program call hierarchies
- Shared copybooks
- Database table access patterns
- File dependencies
- Job scheduling dependencies

### 1.4 Business Impact Assessment

- Critical business functions
- Transaction volumes
- Performance requirements
- Availability requirements (24/7, business hours)
- Regulatory compliance needs

## 2. Target Architecture Design

### 2.1 Technology Stack Selection

**Application Layer:**

- Framework: Spring Boot (recommended), Quarkus, Micronaut
- Language: Java 17+ or Kotlin
- API: REST (Spring REST), GraphQL (Spring GraphQL)
- Async: Spring WebFlux for reactive

**Data Layer:**

- Primary DB: PostgreSQL (cost-effective), Oracle (enterprise), SQL Server
- Caching: Redis, Hazelcast
- Search: Elasticsearch (if needed)
- Message Queue: RabbitMQ, Kafka

**Batch Processing:**

- Spring Batch (enterprise)
- Apache Airflow (complex workflows)
- Kubernetes CronJobs (simple)

**Frontend:**

- Web: React, Angular, Vue.js
- Mobile: React Native, Flutter
- Desktop: Electron (if needed)

**Infrastructure:**

- Cloud: AWS, Azure, GCP
- Containers: Docker
- Orchestration: Kubernetes
- Service Mesh: Istio (optional)

### 2.2 Microservices Decomposition

**Identify Bounded Contexts:**

```
Example for banking:
- Customer Management Service
- Account Service
- Transaction Service
- Loan Service
- Reporting Service
```

**Design Principles:**

- Single Responsibility
- Loose Coupling
- High Cohesion
- Independent Deployability
- Database per Service

**API Design:**

- RESTful conventions
- Versioning strategy (URL, header)
- OpenAPI documentation
- Rate limiting
- Authentication/Authorization (OAuth2, JWT)

### 2.3 Data Architecture

**Database Strategy:**

- Separate databases per microservice
- Shared reference data strategy
- Event-driven data sync
- CQRS pattern (if needed)

**Migration Patterns:**

```
SYMFOWARE → PostgreSQL:
1. Schema conversion
2. Data type mapping
3. Stored procedure conversion
4. Trigger rewrite
5. Performance tuning
```

**File to Database Migration:**

```
ISAM Files → Database Tables:
- Create table with primary key
- Add appropriate indexes
- Migrate data with validation
- Update programs to use DB

Sequential Files → Keep or DB:
- Low frequency: Keep as files
- High frequency: Consider database
- Batch processing: File might be fine
```

## 3. Migration Strategy Selection

### 3.1 Strangler Fig Pattern (Recommended)

**Approach:**
Gradually replace functionality while keeping system operational.

**Steps:**

1. Identify first bounded context to migrate
2. Build new service with same interface
3. Route traffic to new service
4. Validate results in parallel
5. Cutover when confidence high
6. Repeat for next context

**Advantages:**

- Lower risk
- Continuous value delivery
- Learn and adjust
- Rollback easier

**Disadvantages:**

- Longer timeline
- Integration complexity
- Maintaining two systems

**Best for:**

- Large, complex systems
- Risk-averse organizations
- Limited migration team

### 3.2 Big Bang Migration

**Approach:**
Complete rewrite, cutover at once.

**Steps:**

1. Build entire new system
2. Migrate all data
3. Extensive testing
4. Single cutover event

**Advantages:**

- Clean architecture
- Shorter calendar time (if successful)
- No hybrid complexity

**Disadvantages:**

- Very high risk
- Long time to value
- Difficult rollback

**Best for:**

- Smaller systems
- Greenfield opportunity
- Strong team with mainframe knowledge

### 3.3 Hybrid Approach

**Approach:**
Core services modernized, periphery later.

**Steps:**

1. Identify core 20% delivering 80% value
2. Modernize core services
3. Keep peripheral functions on mainframe
4. Integrate via APIs
5. Gradually modernize peripheral

**Advantages:**

- Balanced risk/reward
- Quick wins possible
- Focus on high value

**Disadvantages:**

- Integration overhead
- Two platforms to maintain

**Best for:**

- Medium complexity
- Budget constraints
- Quick ROI needed

## 4. Data Migration Planning

**Custom Scripts:**

```java
@Service
public class DataMigrationService {
    
    @Transactional
    public void migrateCustomers(String sourceFile) {
        List<Customer> customers = readFromMainframe(sourceFile);
        
        customers.stream()
            .map(this::transform)
            .forEach(customer -> {
                validateAndSave(customer);
                logMigration(customer);
            });
    }
    
    private Customer transform(LegacyCustomer legacy) {
        return Customer.builder()
            .customerId(legacy.getCustId())
            .name(legacy.getCustName().trim())
            .balance(legacy.getBalance())
