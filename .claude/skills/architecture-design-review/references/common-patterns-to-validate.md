# Common Patterns to Validate

## Monolithic Architecture

☐ Justified for project size and complexity
☐ Modularization strategy defined
☐ Scaling strategy documented
☐ Migration path considered (if applicable)

### Microservices Architecture

☐ Service boundaries follow business domains
☐ Services are independently deployable
☐ Database per service enforced
☐ Service communication patterns defined
☐ Service discovery mechanism specified
☐ Circuit breakers and resilience patterns included
☐ Distributed tracing implemented
☐ Saga pattern for transactions (if needed)

### Event-Driven Architecture

☐ Event schemas defined
☐ Event sourcing strategy documented
☐ Event ordering guarantees defined
☐ Dead letter queue handling specified
☐ Event replay capability considered
☐ Message broker selected appropriately

### Serverless Architecture

☐ Function boundaries appropriate
☐ Cold start impact assessed
☐ Stateless design enforced
☐ Vendor lock-in considerations documented
☐ Cost model validated

### Layered Architecture

☐ Layer responsibilities clearly defined
☐ Layer dependencies unidirectional
☐ Cross-cutting concerns addressed
☐ Layer coupling minimized
