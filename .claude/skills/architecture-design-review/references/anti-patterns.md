## Distributed System Anti-Patterns

## 1. Distributed Monolith

**Description**: Microservices that are tightly coupled and must be deployed together.

**Symptoms**:

- Services share same database
- Services call each other synchronously for every operation
- Cannot deploy services independently
- Cascading failures common
- All services must be updated together

**Example**:

```
OrderService → calls → InventoryService → calls → PaymentService
      ↓                        ↓                       ↓
   Same Database         Same Database          Same Database
```

**Why It's Bad**:

- Complexity of microservices without benefits
- Cannot scale services independently
- No fault isolation
- Difficult to develop independently
- Defeats purpose of microservices

**How to Fix**:

- Database per service pattern
- Asynchronous communication via events
- API Gateway for client requests
- Circuit breakers for resilience
- Each service independently deployable

**Alternative Pattern**: Start with modular monolith, extract services when needed.

---

### 2. Chatty Communication

**Description**: Too many fine-grained service calls causing performance issues.

**Symptoms**:

- Multiple API calls to complete one operation
- High network latency
- N+1 query problem across services
- Poor user experience
- High bandwidth usage

**Example**:

```
Client → getOrder() → Order Service
       → getCustomer() → Customer Service
       → getAddress() → Address Service
       → getPayment() → Payment Service
       → getItems() → Item Service (N times for N items)
```

**Why It's Bad**:

- High latency (network round trips)
- Increased failure points
- Resource intensive
- Poor performance
- Difficult to troubleshoot

**How to Fix**:

- Aggregate APIs (BFF - Backend for Frontend)
- GraphQL for flexible querying
- Data denormalization where appropriate
- Batch API endpoints
- Caching layer

**Pattern**: API Gateway with data aggregation

---

### 3. Single Point of Failure (SPOF)

**Description**: Critical component with no redundancy causing system-wide failure.

**Common SPOFs**:

- Single database instance
- Single load balancer
- Single message broker
- Single cache instance
- Single authentication service

**Example**:

```
All Services → Single Database → Failure = Total Outage
```

**Why It's Bad**:

- Complete system failure risk
- No fault tolerance
- Poor availability
- Business impact high
- Customer trust erosion

**How to Fix**:

- Database replication (primary-replica)
- Load balancer redundancy
- Multi-AZ deployment
- Circuit breakers for graceful degradation
- Health checks and auto-recovery

**Pattern**: Active-Passive or Active-Active redundancy

---

### 4. Cascading Failures

**Description**: Failure in one service propagates and causes failures in dependent services.

**Symptoms**:

- One service failure brings down entire system
- Thread pool exhaustion
- Connection pool exhaustion
- Timeout not configured
- No circuit breakers

**Example**:

```
Service A (healthy) → Service B (slow) → Service C (down)
Result: All services fail as threads wait
```

**Why It's Bad**:

- Magnifies impact of single failure
- Difficult to recover
- Affects all dependent services
- Hard to identify root cause
- Extended downtime

**How to Fix**:

- Circuit breaker pattern (Hystrix, Resilience4j)
- Timeouts on all external calls
- Bulkhead pattern for isolation
- Graceful degradation
- Health checks and monitoring

**Patterns**:

- Circuit Breaker
- Bulkhead
- Timeout
- Fallback

---

## Data Management Anti-Patterns

### 5. Database as Integration Point

**Description**: Multiple services sharing the same database tables.

**Symptoms**:

- Services access same tables
- Schema changes affect multiple services
- Tight coupling through data
- Cannot deploy independently
- No service ownership

**Example**:

```
OrderService    →     Shared Database    ←    CustomerService
InvoiceService  →     (Orders, Customers) ←   ShippingService
```

**Why It's Bad**:

- Tight coupling defeats microservices
- Schema changes require coordination
- Cannot scale database per service needs
- No data ownership boundaries
- Transaction spanning services

**How to Fix**:

- Database per service pattern
- Services own their data
- API calls for cross-service data
- Event-driven data synchronization
- CQRS for read models

**Pattern**: Database per Service

---

### 6. Data Monolith

**Description**: Single massive database with all application data.

**Symptoms**:

- One database for all services
- Schema grows indefinitely
- Cannot scale independently
- Backup/restore takes hours
- Performance degradation over time

**Why It's Bad**:

- Scalability bottleneck
- Single point of failure
- Difficult to maintain
- Long backup/restore times
- Technology lock-in

**How to Fix**:

- Separate databases by bounded context
- Read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Sharding for horizontal scaling
- Archive old data
- Different databases for different needs (SQL, NoSQL)

---

### 7. Shared Mutable State

**Description**: Multiple components sharing and modifying the same state.

**Symptoms**:

- Race conditions
- Data corruption
- Difficult to debug
- Unpredictable behavior

- Team coordination overhead

**How to Fix**:

- Decompose by business capability
- Extract smaller services
- Domain-Driven Design

---

### 9. Anemic Domain Model

**Description**: Domain objects with no behavior, just data and getters/setters.

**Symptoms**:

- POJOs with only getters/setters
- Business logic in service layer
- Entities are just data containers
- No domain behavior
- Procedural programming in OO language

**Example**:

```java
// Anemic
class Order {
    private double total;
    public double getTotal() { return total; }
    public void setTotal(double total) { this.total = total; }
}

class OrderService {
    public void calculateTotal(Order order, List<Item> items) {
        double total = 0;
        for (Item item : items) {
            total += item.getPrice() * item.getQuantity();
        }
        order.setTotal(total);
    }
}
```

**Why It's Bad**:

- Not object-oriented
- Business logic scattered
- Difficult to test
- Violates encapsulation
- Procedural mindset

**How to Fix - Rich Domain Model**:

```java
class Order {
    private List<OrderItem> items;
    private Money total;
    
    public void addItem(Product product, int quantity) {
        items.add(new OrderItem(product, quantity));
        recalculateTotal();
    }
    
    private void recalculateTotal() {
        total = items.stream()
            .map(OrderItem::getSubtotal)
            .reduce(Money.ZERO, Money::add);
    }
    
    public Money getTotal() { return total; }
}
```

## Summary

Anti-patterns are common pitfalls that seem like good solutions but cause problems. Key takeaways:

1. **Recognize anti-patterns early** - easier to fix
2. **Understand the "why"** - learn the root cause
3. **Apply patterns, not anti-patterns** - know the difference
4. **Context matters** - what's anti-pattern in one context may be acceptable in another
5. **Refactor gradually** - don't try to fix everything at once

Remember: "The first rule of architecture is: don't over-architect." Keep it simple, measure, and improve based on actual needs.
