## Quality Attribute Trade-offs

Architecture is about making trade-offs between quality attributes:

**Performance vs Security**

- Encryption adds overhead
- Authentication checks add latency
- Balance: Cache authenticated results, optimize encryption

**Scalability vs Consistency**

- Distributed systems: eventual consistency
- Strong consistency limits scalability
- Balance: CQRS, eventual consistency where acceptable

**Availability vs Consistency** (CAP Theorem)

- Can't have both under partition
- Choose based on requirements
- Balance: Multi-master replication with conflict resolution

**Performance vs Maintainability**

- Optimization can add complexity
- Premature optimization technical debt
- Balance: Measure first, optimize bottlenecks

**Flexibility vs Simplicity**

- Over-engineering for future needs
- YAGNI principle
- Balance: Simple design, extensibility points
