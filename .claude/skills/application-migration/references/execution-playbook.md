### 3. Rollback Procedure

**When to Rollback:**

- Critical functionality not working
- Data corruption detected
- Performance below acceptable thresholds
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Cannot resolve issue within cutover window

**Rollback Steps:**

```markdown
1. Declare Rollback Decision (5 minutes)
   - Migration Lead makes decision
   - Notify all stakeholders
   - Begin rollback procedure

2. Redirect Traffic (10 minutes)
   - Update DNS to legacy system
   - Update load balancer rules
   - Stop new application

3. Verify Legacy System (15 minutes)
   - Check legacy system health
   - Verify data synchronized back
   - Test critical functions
   - Confirm users can access

4. Communication (Ongoing)
   - Notify users of restoration
   - Inform stakeholders
   - Document rollback reason

5. Post-Rollback Analysis (24 hours)
   - Root cause analysis
