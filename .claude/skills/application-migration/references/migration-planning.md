# Migration Planning

## 1. Create Migration Roadmap

**Phased Approach:**

```markdown
Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
- Set up cloud infrastructure
- Establish CI/CD pipelines
- Deploy monitoring and logging
- Create API gateway
- Migrate reference data
- Build authentication service
- Deliverable: Core infrastructure ready

Phase 2: Read-Only Services (Months 4-6)
- Migrate product catalog (read)
- Migrate customer profiles (read)
- Migrate reporting/analytics
- Keep writes to legacy system
- Deliverable: 30% traffic on new platform

Phase 3: Write Services (Months 7-9)
- Migrate customer updates
- Migrate order creation
- Migrate inventory management
- Bi-directional data sync
- Deliverable: 60% traffic on new platform

Phase 4: Complex Workflows (Months 10-12)
- Migrate payment processing
- Migrate fulfillment workflows
- Migrate integrations
- Deliverable: 90% traffic on new platform

Phase 5: Decommission (Month 13)
- Final data migration
- Legacy system retired
- Deliverable: 100% on new platform
```

### 2. Data Migration Strategy

**Data Migration Phases:**

```markdown
Phase 1: Data Analysis
- Profile source data (quality, volume, structure)
- Map source to target schema
- Identify transformations needed
- Estimate migration duration

Phase 2: Data Cleansing
- Remove duplicates
- Fix data quality issues
- Standardize formats
- Archive obsolete data

Phase 3: Initial Load
- Migrate historical data
- Validate data integrity
- Run reconciliation reports
- Fix discrepancies

Phase 4: Delta Sync
- Replicate ongoing changes
- Minimize cutover data lag
- Use CDC (Change Data Capture) or batch sync

Phase 5: Final Cutover
- Final data sync
- Validate completeness
- Lock source system
- Switch to target system
```

**Data Transformation Example:**

```sql
-- Legacy: Single customer table with embedded address
-- Target: Normalized customer and address tables

-- Transformation Logic
INSERT INTO customers (id, first_name, last_name, email)
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  SUBSTRING(customer_name, 1, POSITION(' ' IN customer_name)-1) as first_name,
  SUBSTRING(customer_name, POSITION(' ' IN customer_name)+1) as last_name,
  customer_email
FROM legacy_customers
WHERE active_flag = 'Y';

INSERT INTO addresses (customer_id, street, city, state, zip)
SELECT
  customer_id,
  customer_address,
  customer_city,
  customer_state,
  customer_zip
FROM legacy_customers
WHERE active_flag = 'Y'
  AND customer_address IS NOT NULL;
```

### 3. Testing Strategy

**Test Types:**

```markdown
1. Unit Tests
- Test individual services
- Mock external dependencies
- Target: >80% code coverage

2. Integration Tests
- Test service interactions
- Test API contracts
- Test database operations
- Validate data transformations

3. End-to-End Tests
- Test complete business workflows
- User journey validation
- Cross-service scenarios

4. Performance Tests
- Load testing: Expected volume
- Stress testing: 2x expected volume
- Soak testing: Sustained load over time
- Target: Meet performance SLAs

5. Compatibility Tests
- Legacy system integration
- Third-party API compatibility
- Browser/device compatibility

6. Data Validation Tests
- Record count reconciliation
- Data integrity checks
- Business rule validation
- Before/after comparison

7. User Acceptance Testing
- Real users test real scenarios
- Validate business processes
- Identify usability issues
```

**Test Data Strategy:**

```markdown
Production Copy:
- Full copy of production data (anonymized)
- Use: Final validation, performance testing
- Refresh: Weekly during migration

Synthetic Data:
- Generated test data
- Use: Development, integration testing
- Volume: 10% of production

Subset:
- Representative sample from production
- Use: Functional testing, debugging
- Size: 1000 customers, 10K orders
```

### 4. Risk Management

**Common Migration Risks:**

```markdown
Risk: Data Loss During Migration
Probability: Medium | Impact: Critical
Mitigation:
- Multiple backups before cutover
- Incremental migration with checkpoints
- Automated data validation
- Rollback procedures tested
Contingency: Restore from backup, revert to legacy

Risk: Performance Degradation
Probability: High | Impact: High
Mitigation:
- Load testing before cutover
- Gradual traffic increase
- Auto-scaling configured
- Performance monitoring active
Contingency: Roll back traffic to legacy, optimize

Risk: Integration Failures
Probability: Medium | Impact: High
Mitigation:
- Test all integrations in staging
- Keep legacy integration active during transition
- Circuit breakers implemented
Contingency: Fallback to legacy integrations

Risk: User Adoption Issues
Probability: Medium | Impact: Medium
Mitigation:
- Training before launch
- Documentation prepared
- Support team ready
- Gradual user migration
Contingency: Extended dual-running period

Risk: Extended Downtime
Probability: Low | Impact: Critical
Mitigation:
- Practice cutover in staging
- Detailed runbook
- Rollback plan ready
- 24/7 team during cutover
Contingency: Rollback to legacy system
```
