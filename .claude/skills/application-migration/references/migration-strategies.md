# Migration Strategies

## 1. Rehost (Lift and Shift)

**When to Use:**

- Quick migration needed
- Minimal changes acceptable
- Infrastructure cost reduction primary goal
- Low risk tolerance

**Approach:**

```markdown
Steps:
1. Provision equivalent cloud infrastructure
2. Set up networking and security
3. Migrate applications as-is
4. Migrate data with minimal transformation
5. Update DNS and routing
6. Verify functionality

Example: Move VM-based app to AWS EC2
- Same OS, same runtime, same configuration
- Benefits: Fast, low risk
- Drawbacks: Doesn't leverage cloud benefits
```

**Effort**: Low | **Risk**: Low | **Value**: Low

### 2. Replatform (Lift and Reshape)

**When to Use:**

- Want some cloud benefits without full rewrite
- Database or runtime modernization beneficial
- Balanced approach needed

**Approach:**

```markdown
Steps:
1. Identify platform upgrades (e.g., DB2 → PostgreSQL)
2. Update configurations for target platform
3. Modify data layer for new database
4. Test compatibility
5. Migrate and validate

Example: Migrate app to managed services
- Keep application code mostly unchanged
- Move database to RDS or Aurora
- Use managed services (Redis, S3)
- Benefits: Better scalability, reduced ops overhead
- Drawbacks: Some application changes needed
```

**Effort**: Medium | **Risk**: Medium | **Value**: Medium

### 3. Refactor (Re-architect)

**When to Use:**

- Significant business value from modernization
- Current architecture limiting business
- Long-term investment warranted

**Approach:**

```markdown
Steps:
1. Design target microservices architecture
2. Identify service boundaries
3. Rewrite services incrementally
4. Implement API contracts
5. Migrate data to appropriate stores
6. Decompose monolith gradually

Example: Monolith to microservices
- Break into bounded contexts
- Build new services with modern stack
- Use API gateway for routing
- Benefits: Scalability, independent deployment, tech flexibility
- Drawbacks: High effort, complex, long timeline
```

**Effort**: High | **Risk**: High | **Value**: High

### 4. Strangler Fig Pattern (Recommended)

**When to Use:**

- Minimize risk during large migrations
- Maintain business continuity essential
- Gradual migration preferred

**Approach:**

```markdown
Phase 1: Setup Infrastructure
- Deploy API gateway/proxy
- Route all traffic through proxy
- Legacy system continues serving requests

Phase 2: Incremental Replacement
- Identify high-value, low-risk functionality
- Build new service for that functionality
- Route specific requests to new service
- Legacy handles remaining requests

Phase 3: Gradual Migration
- Continue replacing functionality piece by piece
- Data synchronized between old and new
- Monitor and validate each migration

Phase 4: Decommission Legacy
- When all functionality migrated
- Redirect all traffic to new services
- Decommission legacy system

Example: E-commerce Migration
Week 1-4: Product catalog service (read-only)
Week 5-8: Product search service
Week 9-12: Shopping cart service
Week 13-16: Order processing service
Week 17-20: Payment processing
Week 21-24: Legacy decommissioned
```

**Effort**: High | **Risk**: Low | **Value**: High | **Recommended**: ✓

### 5. Big Bang Migration

**When to Use:**

- Small, simple application
- Short maintenance window acceptable
- Testing fully validates migration

**Approach:**

```markdown
Preparation:
- Build complete target system
- Migrate and validate all data
- Test thoroughly in staging

Cutover:
- Schedule maintenance window
- Final data sync
- Switch DNS/routing to new system
- Rollback plan ready

Example: Weekend cutover
Fri 6pm: Begin final data migration
Sat 2am: Complete data sync
Sat 4am: Switch traffic to new system
Sat 6am: Validation complete
Mon 8am: Users on new system
```

**Effort**: Medium | **Risk**: Very High | **Value**: Medium | **Use Sparingly**

## Migration Patterns by Application Type

### Mainframe Applications
