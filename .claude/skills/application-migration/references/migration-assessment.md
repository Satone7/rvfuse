# Migration Assessment

## 1. Current State Analysis

**Inventory Existing Systems:**

```markdown
Application: Legacy CRM System
Technology Stack:
- Language: COBOL, JCL
- Database: DB2 on mainframe
- Infrastructure: IBM z/OS mainframe
- Integration: Batch file transfers, MQ
- Users: 500 concurrent, 2000 total
- Data Volume: 5TB
- Transaction Volume: 10K/day

Business Criticality: High
Uptime Requirement: 99.9%
Compliance: PCI-DSS, SOX
```

**Assess Application Characteristics:**

- **Architecture**: Monolith, microservices, n-tier, batch processing
- **Dependencies**: External systems, APIs, databases, file shares
- **Data Complexity**: Schema complexity, data volume, referential integrity
- **Customizations**: Extent of custom code vs. standard functionality
- **Integration Points**: Number and complexity of integrations
- **Technical Debt**: Code quality, outdated frameworks, security issues
- **Documentation**: Quality and completeness of existing docs

**Identify Migration Drivers:**

- **Cost Reduction**: Reduce licensing, infrastructure, or maintenance costs
- **Performance**: Improve response times, throughput, scalability
- **Modernization**: Adopt modern tech stack, architecture patterns
- **Cloud Benefits**: Scalability, reliability, geographic distribution
- **Compliance**: Meet new regulatory requirements
- **End of Support**: Vendor discontinuing platform/language
- **Business Agility**: Enable faster feature delivery

### 2. Target State Definition

**Define Target Architecture:**

```markdown
Target: Cloud-Native CRM

Technology Stack:
- Frontend: React, TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js microservices, Java Spring Boot
- Database: PostgreSQL (Aurora), MongoDB (Atlas)
- Infrastructure: AWS (ECS, Lambda, RDS)
- Integration: REST APIs, Event-driven (Kafka)
- Authentication: Auth0, SSO
- Monitoring: CloudWatch, DataDog

Architecture Pattern: Microservices with API Gateway
Deployment: Containers (ECS), Serverless (Lambda)
Data Strategy: Polyglot persistence
```

**Success Criteria:**

- **Performance**: 95th percentile response time < 200ms
- **Availability**: 99.95% uptime SLA
- **Scalability**: Support 2x current load without degradation
- **Cost**: Reduce total cost of ownership by 40%
- **Time-to-Market**: Reduce feature delivery from months to weeks
- **Security**: Pass security audit, achieve SOC 2 compliance

### 3. Gap Analysis

**Technical Gaps:**

```markdown
| Capability | Current | Target | Gap | Priority |
| ------------ | --------- |--------|-----|----------|
| API Layer | None | REST/GraphQL | Need to build | High |
| Authentication | Custom | OAuth 2.0/SAML | Need integration | High |
| Monitoring | Basic logs | APM, distributed tracing | Tooling needed | Medium |
| CI/CD | Manual | Automated pipelines | DevOps setup | High |
| Testing | Manual | Automated test suite | Test automation | Medium |
| Database | DB2 | PostgreSQL | Migration + conversion | High |
```

**Skill Gaps:**

- Current team: COBOL, mainframe
- Target needs: JavaScript/Node.js, React, AWS, containers
- Training required: 3-6 months for upskilling
- Hiring needs: 2 senior cloud engineers, 1 DevOps engineer
