# Review Report Format

## Output Guidelines

**Be Specific:**

- Reference exact line numbers and file paths
- Quote problematic code snippets
- Provide concrete examples and metrics

**Be Constructive:**

- Explain WHY something is an issue (impact on maintainability, performance, security)
- Suggest HOW to fix it with specific recommendations
- Provide improved code examples showing the solution

**Be Balanced:**

- Acknowledge good practices and strengths
- Prioritize issues appropriately (P0-P3)
- Consider effort vs. benefit in recommendations

**Be Professional:**

- Focus on code quality, not developers
- Use objective criteria and metrics
- Provide educational context where helpful
