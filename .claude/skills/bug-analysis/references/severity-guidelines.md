# Severity Guidelines and Triage

## Severity Classification

## Critical (P0)

**Criteria:**

- Complete system outage or crash
- Data loss or corruption
- Security breach or critical vulnerability
- Payment/transaction processing failure
- No workaround available
- Affects all or majority of users

**Response Time:** Immediate (< 1 hour)

**Examples:**

- Database connection failure causing site downtime
- Payment gateway not processing transactions
- User data exposed to unauthorized access
- System crashes on startup for all users
- Critical security vulnerability actively exploited

**Required Actions:**

- Immediate team notification
- Escalate to on-call engineer
- Create incident war room
- Implement emergency fix or rollback
- Post-mortem required

---

### High (P1)

**Criteria:**

- Major feature completely broken
- Significant user impact (>25% of users)
- Moderate security vulnerability
- Difficult or complex workaround
- Revenue-impacting issue
- SLA violation risk

**Response Time:** Same day (< 4 hours)

**Examples:**

- Login failure for subset of users
- Core feature (search, checkout) not working
- API returning errors for multiple clients
- Performance degradation causing timeouts
- Data sync failures between systems

**Required Actions:**

- Assign to senior engineer
- Provide status updates every 2 hours
- Implement fix in hotfix branch
- Deploy outside normal release cycle
- Notify affected customers

---

### Medium (P2)

**Criteria:**

- Feature partially broken
- Moderate user impact (<25% of users)
- Reasonable workaround available
- Non-critical functionality affected
- Minor performance degradation

**Response Time:** Within 1 week

**Examples:**

- Secondary feature not working correctly
- UI element not displaying properly
- Export feature failing for specific file types
- Search results occasionally incorrect
- Minor memory leak not causing immediate issues

**Required Actions:**

- Include in next sprint planning
- Fix in regular release cycle
- Add to regression test suite
- Document workaround in knowledge base

---

### Low (P3)

**Criteria:**

- Minor issue or edge case
- Cosmetic problem
- Minimal user impact
- Easy workaround
- Nice-to-have enhancement

**Response Time:** Backlog/next release

**Examples:**

- Spelling/grammar errors
- Minor alignment issues
- Console warnings (non-breaking)
- Rare edge case handling
- Legacy browser compatibility

**Required Actions:**

- Add to backlog
- Fix when convenient
- May be combined with other small fixes
- Consider for future releases

| High | P1 - Same day | P1 - Same day | P2 - This week |
| Medium | P2 - This week | P2 - This week | P3 - Backlog |
| Low | P3 - Backlog | P3 - Backlog | P4 - Won't fix |

## Triage Process

### Step 1: Initial Assessment (5 minutes)

1. Read bug description
2. Check if reproducible
3. Identify affected component
4. Assess initial severity
5. Check for duplicates

### Step 2: Categorization (5 minutes)

1. Assign bug type
2. Identify root cause pattern (if obvious)
3. Tag with relevant labels
4. Assign to appropriate team/component

### Step 3: Priority Assignment (5 minutes)

Consider:

- Number of users affected
- Business impact (revenue, reputation)
- Security implications
- Workaround availability
- Effort to fix

### Step 4: Assignment (2 minutes)

- P0/P1: Assign immediately to on-call or senior engineer
- P2: Add to current sprint
- P3: Add to backlog

### Step 5: Stakeholder Communication

- P0/P1: Notify stakeholders immediately
- P2: Include in sprint planning
- P3: Update in weekly summary

## Special Considerations

### Security Vulnerabilities

**Always escalate to security team for:**

- Authentication bypasses
- Authorization failures
- Data exposure
- Injection vulnerabilities
- Known CVEs

**Use CVSS scoring:**

- 9.0-10.0: Critical
- 7.0-8.9: High
- 4.0-6.9: Medium
- 0.1-3.9: Low

### Production vs Non-Production

**Production bugs:**

- Higher priority by default
- Require faster response
- May need hotfix deployment

**Non-production bugs:**

- Can wait for regular release
- Use for testing improvements
- May indicate test coverage gaps

### Customer-Reported vs Internal

**Customer-reported:**

- Higher priority (affects users)
- Requires customer communication
- May need workaround documentation

**Internal:**

- Can be fixed proactively
- Opportunity to prevent customer impact
- Use for quality improvements
