# Design Considerations

## For Different Scale Levels

**Small Scale (< 1K users)**

- Monolithic architecture
- Single database instance
- Simple deployment (VM or PaaS)
- Basic monitoring
- Manual scaling

**Medium Scale (1K - 100K users)**

- Modular monolithic or early microservices
- Database read replicas
- Load balancing
- Caching layer
- Container orchestration
- Auto-scaling

**Large Scale (100K - 1M+ users)**

- Full microservices architecture
- Distributed data stores
- Multiple caching layers
- CDN for static content
- Multi-region deployment
- Advanced monitoring and observability
- Chaos engineering
