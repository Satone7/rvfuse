# Architecture Design Process

Follow this systematic approach when designing software architectures:

## Phase 1: Discovery & Requirements

1. **Gather Requirements**
   - Functional requirements (features, use cases)
   - Non-functional requirements (performance, scalability, security)
   - Business constraints (budget, timeline, compliance)
   - Technical constraints (existing systems, team skills)

2. **Analyze Architecture Drivers**
   - Performance requirements (latency, throughput)
   - Scalability needs (user growth, data volume)
   - Availability targets (uptime SLA, disaster recovery)
   - Security requirements (authentication, authorization, compliance)
   - Maintainability goals (testability, modularity)

3. **Define System Context**
   - Identify stakeholders
   - Map external systems and dependencies
   - Define system boundaries
   - Identify integration points

### Phase 2: Architecture Design

1. **Choose Architecture Style**
   - **Monolithic**: Single deployable unit, shared database
     - Use for: Simple applications, MVPs, small teams
   - **Modular Monolithic**: Organized modules, single deployment
     - Use for: Medium complexity, clear domain boundaries
   - **Microservices**: Independent services, separate databases
     - Use for: Large scale, team autonomy, different tech stacks
   - **Serverless**: Function-based, managed infrastructure
     - Use for: Event-driven, variable load, cost optimization
   - **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous communication, event streams
     - Use for: Real-time processing, loose coupling, scalability

2. **Design System Components**
   - **Presentation Layer**: Web, mobile, desktop interfaces
   - **API Layer**: REST, GraphQL, gRPC endpoints
   - **Application Layer**: Business logic, orchestration
   - **Domain Layer**: Core business entities and rules
   - **Data Layer**: Databases, caches, data stores
   - **Integration Layer**: External APIs, message brokers

3. **Define Data Architecture**
   - Data models and schemas
   - Database selection (transactional, analytical, operational)
   - Data flow and transformation pipelines
   - Caching strategies (in-memory, distributed)
   - Data consistency models (eventual, strong)

4. **Design Integration Patterns**
   - **Synchronous**: REST APIs, GraphQL, gRPC
   - **Asynchronous**: Message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ), event streams
   - **Batch**: ETL processes, scheduled jobs
   - **Real-time**: WebSockets, Server-Sent Events

### Phase 3: Quality Attributes

Address key quality attributes in your design:

1. **Scalability**
   - Horizontal scaling: Load balancers, stateless services
   - Vertical scaling: Resource optimization
   - Database scaling: Read replicas, sharding, partitioning
   - Caching: Redis, Memcached, CDN
   - Auto-scaling: Cloud-native scaling policies

2. **Performance**
   - Response time optimization
   - Throughput maximization
   - Resource utilization efficiency
   - Database query optimization
   - Caching strategies
   - Asynchronous processing

3. **Security**
   - Authentication: OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, SAML
   - Authorization: RBAC, ABAC, policy-based
   - Data encryption: At rest, in transit (TLS/SSL)
   - API security: API keys, rate limiting, WAF
   - Network security: VPC, firewalls, security groups
   - Compliance: GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS

4. **Reliability & Availability**
   - Fault tolerance: Redundancy, failover
   - Resilience patterns: Circuit breakers, retries, timeouts
   - Health monitoring: Liveness, readiness probes
   - Disaster recovery: Backups, replication, multi-region
   - SLA targets: 99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999%

5. **Maintainability**
   - Code organization: Clean architecture, SOLID principles
   - Modularity: Domain-driven design, bounded contexts
   - Testability: Unit, integration, e2e tests
   - Documentation: Code comments, API docs, architecture docs
   - Monitoring: Logging, metrics, tracing

### Phase 4: Technology Selection

Recommend appropriate technologies based on requirements:

1. **Backend Technologies**
   - **Java/Spring Boot**: Enterprise, microservices, strong typing
   - **Node.js/Express**: JavaScript, async I/O, real-time
   - **Python/Django/FastAPI**: Rapid development, data science, ML
   - **.NET Core**: Microsoft ecosystem, enterprise
   - **Go**: High performance, concurrency, cloud-native
   - **Rust**: System programming, performance-critical

2. **Frontend Technologies**
   - **React**: Component-based, large ecosystem, SPA
   - **Vue.js**: Progressive, flexible, easy learning curve
   - **Angular**: Full framework, TypeScript, enterprise
   - **Next.js**: React SSR, static generation, full-stack
   - **Mobile**: React Native, Flutter, native (Swift/Kotlin)

3. **Databases**

   - **NoSQL Document**: MongoDB, CouchDB (flexible schema, JSON)
   - **NoSQL Key-Value**: Redis, DynamoDB (caching, sessions)
   - **NoSQL Column**: Cassandra, HBase (time-series, high write)
   - **NoSQL Graph**: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune (relationships, networks)
   - **Search**: Elasticsearch, Solr (full-text search, analytics)

4. **Cloud Platforms**
   - **AWS**: Comprehensive services, market leader
   - **Azure**: Microsoft integration, enterprise
   - **GCP**: Data analytics, machine learning, Kubernetes
   - **Multi-cloud**: Avoid vendor lock-in, regional presence

### Phase 5: Documentation

Produce comprehensive architecture documentation:

1. **Architecture Diagrams (All in Mermaid format)**
   - **C4 Context Diagram**: System in its environment (use Mermaid C4Context)
   - **C4 Container Diagram**: High-level technology choices (use Mermaid C4Container)
   - **C4 Component Diagram**: Components within containers (use Mermaid C4Component)
   - **Sequence Diagrams**: Interaction flows (use Mermaid sequenceDiagram)
   - **Deployment Diagram**: Infrastructure and deployment (use Mermaid flowchart or C4Deployment)

2. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**

   ```markdown
   # ADR-001: Use Microservices Architecture
   
   ## Status
   Accepted
   
   ## Context
   The system needs to support multiple development teams, different
   technology stacks, and independent scaling of components.
   
   ## Decision
   We will implement a microservices architecture with separate services
   for user management, ordering, payment, and inventory.
   
   ## Consequences
   - Positive: Team autonomy, independent scaling, technology flexibility
   - Negative: Increased complexity, distributed system challenges
   - Risks: Network latency, data consistency, operational overhead
   ```

3. **Technical Specifications**
   - System overview and goals
   - Architecture patterns and principles
   - Component descriptions and responsibilities
   - Data models and schemas
   - API contracts (OpenAPI/Swagger)
   - Infrastructure requirements
   - Security controls
   - Monitoring and observability strategy

4. **Implementation Roadmap**

   - Phase 2: Core features (business logic, APIs)
   - Phase 3: Integration (external systems, third-party)
   - Phase 4: Advanced features (analytics, ML)
   - Migration strategy (if applicable)
