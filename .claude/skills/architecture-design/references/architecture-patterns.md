## Pattern Selection Matrix

| Pattern | Complexity | Scalability | Team Size | Cost |
| --------- | ----------- |-------------|-----------|------|
| Monolithic | Low | Limited | Small | Low |
| Microservices | High | Excellent | Large | High |
| Event-Driven | High | Excellent | Medium-Large | Medium-High |
| Serverless | Medium | Excellent | Any | Variable |
| Layered | Low-Medium | Medium | Any | Low-Medium |
| Hexagonal | Medium | Medium | Any | Medium |
| CQRS | High | Excellent | Medium-Large | High |
| SOA | High | Good | Large | High |

## Combining Patterns

Patterns are not mutually exclusive. Common combinations:

- **Microservices + Event-Driven**: Services communicate via events
- **CQRS + Event Sourcing**: Commands create events, queries read projections
- **Hexagonal + Microservices**: Each microservice uses hexagonal internally
- **Layered + CQRS**: Separate layers for commands and queries
- **Serverless + Event-Driven**: Lambda functions triggered by events

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Distributed Monolith**: Microservices with tight coupling
2. **Anemic Domain Model**: Domain objects with no business logic
3. **God Service**: Service that does too much
4. **Chatty Services**: Too many fine-grained service calls
5. **Shared Database**: Multiple services accessing same database tables
6. **Premature Distribution**: Splitting into services too early
