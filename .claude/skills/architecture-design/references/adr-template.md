## Example ADRs

### Example 1: Database Selection

```markdown
# ADR-001: Use PostgreSQL as Primary Database

## Status
ACCEPTED

## Date
2026-01-14

## Context
We need to select a database for our e-commerce platform that will:
- Handle transactional data (orders, payments, inventory)
- Support complex queries for reporting and analytics
- Scale to 100K daily active users
- Provide strong data consistency
- Support both structured and semi-structured data (product attributes)

Our team has SQL experience but limited NoSQL experience.
Budget is limited, so we prefer open-source solutions.

## Decision
We will use PostgreSQL as our primary database for all transactional and analytical data.

Implementation approach:
- PostgreSQL 15+ for ACID transactions
- Use JSONB columns for flexible product attributes
- Implement read replicas for read-heavy queries
- Use connection pooling (PgBouncer)
- Schedule for partitioning large tables (orders, logs)

## Consequences

### Positive
- Strong ACID guarantees for financial transactions
- Rich query capabilities with SQL
- JSONB support provides schema flexibility where needed
- Mature ecosystem with good tooling
- Excellent documentation and community support
- Team already knows SQL
- Lower total cost of ownership (open-source)
- Proven scalability for our expected load

### Negative
- Vertical scaling limitations (though not an issue at our scale)
- Manual sharding required for extreme scale
- More complex to operate than managed NoSQL solutions
- JSONB queries are less performant than native document stores

### Risks
- **Risk**: Write bottlenecks as we scale
  - **Mitigation**: Implement caching layer (Redis), database connection pooling, and optimize queries
- **Risk**: Running out of primary database capacity
  - **Mitigation**: Set up monitoring and alerting, plan for read replicas early
- **Risk**: Complex migration if we need to move to distributed database later
  - **Mitigation**: Design data access layer with abstraction to minimize coupling

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: MongoDB
- **Description**: Use MongoDB for flexible schema and horizontal scalability
- **Pros**: Flexible schema, horizontal scaling, simpler sharding
- **Cons**: Weaker consistency guarantees, team less familiar, transaction limitations across collections
- **Why Rejected**: Our use case requires strong consistency for financial data, and we don't need the extreme horizontal scalability that MongoDB provides

### Alternative 2: MySQL
- **Description**: Use MySQL as a widely-adopted relational database
- **Pros**: Widely used, good performance, familiar to team
- **Cons**: Less feature-rich than PostgreSQL, weaker JSON support
- **Why Rejected**: PostgreSQL offers better JSON support and more advanced features (CTEs, window functions) that we need for analytics

### Alternative 3: Amazon Aurora
- **Description**: Use AWS Aurora for managed PostgreSQL with auto-scaling
- **Pros**: Managed service, auto-scaling, high availability
- **Cons**: Higher cost, AWS vendor lock-in, limited control
- **Why Rejected**: Current budget constraints and desire to avoid vendor lock-in. We can revisit this as a managed option later

## Implementation Notes
- Start with single PostgreSQL instance
- Set up automated backups (daily full, hourly incremental)
- Implement monitoring from day one (query performance, connection pool, disk usage)
- Phase 2: Add read replica for analytics queries
- Phase 3: Implement table partitioning for order history

### Example 2: Microservices Decomposition

```markdown
# ADR-002: Adopt Microservices Architecture with Domain-Driven Design

## Status
ACCEPTED

## Date
2026-01-14

## Context
Our monolithic e-commerce application has grown to 200K lines of code with:
- 3 development teams working on different features
- Frequent deployment conflicts and coordination overhead
- Scaling challenges (can only scale entire application)
- Technology lock-in (everything must be in Java/Spring)
- Increasing build and deployment times (15+ minutes)

Business requirements:
- Support for 500K daily active users (5x current)
- Faster feature delivery (weekly deployments per team)
- Ability to experiment with new technologies (e.g., Node.js for real-time features)

## Decision
We will decompose the monolith into microservices using Domain-Driven Design principles.

Service boundaries:
1. **User Service**: Authentication, profiles, preferences
2. **Product Catalog Service**: Products, categories, search
3. **Order Service**: Order management, cart
4. **Payment Service**: Payment processing, refunds
5. **Inventory Service**: Stock management, reservations
6. **Notification Service**: Emails, SMS, push notifications

Communication:
- Synchronous: REST APIs for query operations
- Asynchronous: Kafka for events (OrderCreated, PaymentProcessed, etc.)
- API Gateway: Kong for routing, authentication, rate limiting

Data:
- Each service owns its database (database per service pattern)
- Event-driven data synchronization where needed
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Team Autonomy**: Each team can work independently with fewer conflicts
- **Independent Scaling**: Scale services based on actual load (e.g., Product Catalog gets 80% of traffic)
- **Technology Flexibility**: Can use different languages (Node.js for Notification Service)
- **Faster Deployments**: Deploy services independently, multiple times per day
- **Fault Isolation**: Issues in one service don't bring down entire system
- **Better Organization**: Clear service boundaries align with business domains

### Negative
- **Increased Complexity**: Distributed system challenges (network, consistency)
- **Operational Overhead**: More deployments, more monitoring, more infrastructure
- **Data Consistency**: Need to handle eventual consistency
- **Testing Complexity**: More complex integration and end-to-end testing
- **Initial Development Slowdown**: Time needed for decomposition
- **Network Latency**: Inter-service calls add latency

### Risks
- **Risk**: Distributed transactions fail (e.g., order created but payment fails)
  - **Mitigation**: Implement Saga pattern with compensating transactions
- **Risk**: Service dependencies create cascading failures
  - **Mitigation**: Implement circuit breakers, timeouts, fallbacks
- **Risk**: Increased operational complexity overwhelms team
  - **Mitigation**: Invest in DevOps automation, monitoring, and training
- **Risk**: Poor service boundaries lead to chatty services
  - **Mitigation**: Use DDD to identify proper boundaries, monitor inter-service calls

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Modular Monolith
- **Description**: Refactor existing monolith into clear modules with strong boundaries
- **Pros**: Simpler deployment, no distributed system complexity, lower overhead
- **Cons**: Still single deployment unit, can't scale independently, technology lock-in remains
- **Why Rejected**: Doesn't address independent scaling and technology flexibility needs

### Alternative 2: Two-Phase Migration (Modular Monolith → Microservices)
- **Description**: First create modular monolith, then extract services gradually
- **Pros**: Lower risk, incremental approach, learn boundaries before splitting
- **Cons**: Longer timeline, multiple migrations
- **Why Rejected**: Business pressure for faster delivery makes two-phase approach too slow

### Alternative 3: Serverless Functions
- **Description**: Use AWS Lambda functions instead of containerized microservices
- **Pros**: No server management, automatic scaling, pay-per-use
- **Cons**: Cold starts, vendor lock-in, 15-minute execution limit, stateless constraints
- **Why Rejected**: Some of our workflows exceed Lambda limits, and we want to avoid AWS lock-in

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)
- Set up Kubernetes cluster
- Implement API Gateway (Kong)
- Set up Kafka cluster
- Create service templates and CI/CD pipelines
- Establish monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger)

### Phase 2: Extract First Service (Month 3)
- Start with Notification Service (lowest risk, fewer dependencies)
- Validate architecture and tooling
- Learn lessons before extracting more services

### Phase 3: Extract Core Services (Months 4-8)
- User Service
- Product Catalog Service
- Order Service
- Payment Service
- Inventory Service

### Phase 4: Decommission Monolith (Month 9)
- Redirect all traffic to microservices
- Turn off monolith

### Migration Strategy: Strangler Fig Pattern
- Keep monolith running during migration
- Route specific features to new services incrementally
- Gradually "strangle" the monolith
- No big-bang cutover

### Example 3: API Design Decision

```markdown
# ADR-003: Use REST APIs for Synchronous Communication

## Status
ACCEPTED

## Date
2026-01-14

## Context
Our microservices need to communicate synchronously for query operations (e.g., getting user profile, product details).

Requirements:
- Client needs to fetch data from multiple services
- Need to support web, mobile, and third-party integrations
- Team has strong HTTP/REST experience
- Need good tooling and documentation

Technology options: REST, GraphQL, gRPC

## Decision
We will use REST APIs with OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications for all synchronous service-to-service and client-to-service communication.

Standards:
- RESTful conventions (proper HTTP verbs, status codes)
- JSON for request/response bodies
- Versioning via URL path (/v1/users, /v2/users)
- OpenAPI 3.0 specs for all APIs
- Consistent error response format
- API Gateway for routing, authentication, rate limiting

## Consequences

### Positive
- Team already experienced with REST
- Excellent tooling (Postman, Swagger UI, API clients)
- Human-readable (JSON over HTTP)
- Works well with all client types (web, mobile, third-party)
- Wide adoption and community support
- Easy to cache (standard HTTP caching)
- Simple to debug (browser, curl)

### Negative
- Over-fetching/under-fetching compared to GraphQL
- Multiple API calls needed for complex data (N+1 problem)
- Less efficient than gRPC for high-performance needs
- Versioning can be challenging

### Risks
- **Risk**: API changes break clients
  - **Mitigation**: Use API versioning, maintain backward compatibility, communicate changes
- **Risk**: Performance issues with multiple round trips
  - **Mitigation**: Implement BFF (Backend for Frontend) pattern for complex client needs
- **Risk**: Inconsistent API design across services
  - **Mitigation**: Establish API design guidelines, code reviews, linting

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: GraphQL
- **Description**: Single GraphQL endpoint for all data queries
- **Pros**: Solves over-fetching, single round trip, strong typing, excellent developer experience
- **Cons**: Team learning curve, caching complexity, query complexity attacks, less mature in microservices
- **Why Rejected**: Team lacks GraphQL experience, adds complexity for our needs

### Alternative 2: gRPC
- **Description**: Protocol Buffers over HTTP/2
- **Pros**: Better performance, streaming, strong typing, efficient binary protocol
- **Cons**: Not browser-friendly, requires special tooling, team learning curve, harder to debug
- **Why Rejected**: Web client support is important, and we don't have extreme performance requirements that justify gRPC complexity

### Alternative 3: Hybrid (REST + GraphQL BFF)
- **Description**: REST for service-to-service, GraphQL BFF for clients
- **Pros**: Flexibility, optimized for each use case
- **Cons**: Maintaining two API styles, increased complexity
- **Why Rejected**: Added complexity not justified at our current scale

## Implementation Notes
- Use OpenAPI 3.0 for all API specifications
- Generate client libraries from OpenAPI specs
- Implement API Gateway (Kong) for cross-cutting concerns
- Standard error response format: `{"error": {"code": "ERROR_CODE", "message": "Human readable message"}}`
- Use HAL or JSON:API for hypermedia (future consideration)

## Tips for Writing Effective ADRs

1. **Write When the Decision is Made**: Document while context is fresh
2. **Be Specific**: Avoid vague statements; include concrete details
3. **Show Your Work**: Explain alternatives and why they were rejected
4. **Think Long-Term**: Consider how this decision affects future decisions
5. **Update Status**: Mark as SUPERSEDED when decision changes
6. **Link Related ADRs**: Create a decision chain
7. **Keep It Concise**: Aim for 1-2 pages; link to detailed docs
8. **Use Simple Language**: Write for future team members who weren't part of the decision

## When to Write an ADR

Write an ADR for:

- Architectural style decisions (monolith vs microservices)
- Technology selections (database, frameworks)
- Significant pattern adoptions (CQRS, event sourcing)
- Infrastructure decisions (cloud provider, Kubernetes)
- Major refactoring decisions
- Security architecture choices
- Data architecture decisions
- Integration pattern selections

Don't write an ADR for:

- Minor implementation details
- Easily reversible decisions
- Team process decisions (usually)
- Routine technology updates
