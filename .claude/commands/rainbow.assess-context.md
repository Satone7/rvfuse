$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

**IMPORTANT**: Automatically generate a 'docs:' prefixed git commit message (e.g., 'docs: add codebase context assessment') and commit context-assessment.md upon completion.

1. **Setup**: Run `.rainbow/scripts/bash/setup-assess-context.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for CONTEXT_ASSESSMENT, DOCS_DIR, REPO_ROOT, HAS_GIT.

2. **Load context**: Read `memory/ground-rules.md` (if exists), `docs/architecture.md` (if exists), `docs/standards.md` (if exists). Load CONTEXT_ASSESSMENT template (already copied). Adhere to the principles for maximizing system clarity, structural simplicity, and long-term maintainability.

3. **Execute context assessment workflow**: Follow the structure in CONTEXT_ASSESSMENT template to:
   - Identify technology stack and frameworks
   - Analyze project structure and organization
   - Document architectural patterns and design decisions
   - Extract coding conventions and standards
   - Map key components and their relationships
   - Identify data models and storage patterns
   - Document API contracts and integration patterns
   - Assess testing approach and coverage
   - Review build and deployment processes
   - Calculate technical health score

4. **Update agent context**: Run `.rainbow/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` to update agent-specific context with assessment findings.

5. **Stop and report**: Command ends after assessment completion. Report CONTEXT_ASSESSMENT path and technical health score.

   - Validate consistency with ground-rules (if exists)

3. **Agent context update**:
   - Run `.rainbow/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
   - Update agent-specific context with assessment findings
   - Add key patterns and conventions
   - Preserve manual additions between markers

**Output**: Complete context-assessment.md, updated agent context

## Key Rules

- Use absolute paths for all file operations
- Assessment document goes to `docs/context-assessment.md` (project-level, not feature-specific)
- Focus on PATTERNS and CONVENTIONS, not exhaustive code listing
- Extract examples from actual code (show, don't just describe)
- Every major finding MUST have code examples
- Recommendations MUST align with existing patterns
- ERROR if assessment lacks concrete examples
- Reference ground-rules constraints (if exists)
- Consider team conventions and project history

## Technical Health Scoring Formula

```
Technical Health Score (0-100) = (
  Code Quality × 0.30 +
  Architecture × 0.25 +
  Testing × 0.20 +
  Documentation × 0.15 +
  Dependencies × 0.10
)

Where:
- Code Quality: Linting compliance, complexity metrics, duplication
- Architecture: Pattern consistency, modularity, coupling metrics
- Testing: Coverage percentage, test quality, CI integration
- Documentation: README quality, API docs, inline comments
- Dependencies: Up-to-date packages, security, license compliance
```

**Interpretation**:

- 80-100: Excellent (Well-maintained, easy to extend)
- 60-79: Good (Some areas need attention)
- 40-59: Fair (Significant technical debt)
- 0-39: Poor (Major refactoring needed)

## Example Usage

```bash
# First time with existing project (brownfield workflow)
/rainbow.assess-context Analyze our e-commerce platform to understand architecture and patterns
# Then follow up with:
# /rainbow.regulate (create principles based on assessment)
# /rainbow.specify (add new features)

# Assess full stack Node.js/React application
/rainbow.assess-context Analyze our e-commerce platform before adding new payment gateway

# Assess Python Django application
/rainbow.assess-context Review our Django REST API codebase structure and conventions

# Assess with specific focus
/rainbow.assess-context Focus on testing patterns and API integration conventions for our microservices

# Quick assessment for small projects
/rainbow.assess-context Quick assessment of project structure and conventions
```

## Notes

- Run this ONCE per project when first adding Rainbow to existing brownfield codebase
- Run this BEFORE creating project principles in brownfield projects
- The assessment guides how new features should integrate with existing code
- Assessment is stored at `docs/context-assessment.md` (project-level)
- **Recommended workflow**: `/rainbow.assess-context` → `/rainbow.regulate` → `/rainbow.specify`
- Follow up with `/rainbow.regulate` to create project principles based on assessment
- Then use `/rainbow.specify` to create feature specifications
