## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

**IMPORTANT**: Automatically generate a 'docs:' prefixed git commit message (e.g., 'docs: add coding standards and conventions') and commit upon completion.

1. **Setup**: Run `.rainbow/scripts/bash/setup-standardize.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for STANDARDS_DOC, DOCS_DIR, ARCH_DOC, CONSTITUTION. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load context**: Read `memory/ground-rules.md`, `docs/architecture.md` (if exists), and all feature specifications from `specs/*/spec.md`. Load STANDARDS_DOC template (already copied to docs/). Incorporate the essential rules for maximizing source code readability, simplicity and long-term maintainability.

3. **Execute standardization workflow**: Follow the structure in STANDARDS_DOC template to:
   - Define UI naming conventions (MANDATORY for frontend projects)
   - Establish code naming conventions
   - Document file and directory structure standards
   - Define API design standards
   - Establish database naming conventions
   - Document testing standards
   - Define Git workflow and commit message conventions
   - Establish documentation standards
   - Provide a concise, high-signal standards guide for AI agents to ensure consistent, maintainable, and secure code. Exclude overly detailed information and specific examples

4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after standards document completion. Report STANDARDS_DOC path and generated artifacts.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Standards Analysis & Best Practices Research

1. **Analyze project context**:
   - Read architecture.md to understand technology stack
   - **Detect UI layer presence**: Check if project has frontend/UI components
     - Look for: React, Vue, Angular, HTML, CSS, mobile frameworks (React Native, Flutter, SwiftUI)
     - Check for: UI mockups, design specifications, frontend directories
     - Determine: Frontend project, backend-only, or full-stack
   - Read ground-rules.md for existing constraints
   - Read feature specs to identify naming patterns
   - Identify programming languages and frameworks in use

2. **Research best practices** for each technology:
   - UI naming conventions for the UI framework (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
   - Code naming conventions for the backend language (Python, Java, TypeScript, etc.)
   - Database naming conventions for the database system
   - API design standards (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, etc.)
   - Testing conventions for the test frameworks

3. **Research domain-specific conventions**:
   - Web applications: Component naming, CSS class naming, accessibility attributes
   - Mobile applications: Screen naming, view controller naming
   - API services: Endpoint naming, HTTP methods, status codes
   - Desktop applications: Window naming, event handler naming

**Output**: Section 1 (Introduction) and initial research for all standards areas

   - Check consistency with architecture and ground-rules
   - Validate all examples are language-appropriate

**Output**: Complete standards.md in docs/, configuration files, quick reference guides, updated agent context

## Key Rules

- Use absolute paths for all file operations
- Standards document goes to `docs/standards.md` (product-level), NOT `specs/` (feature-level)
- UI naming conventions are MANDATORY for frontend/UI projects - must be comprehensive and detailed
- UI naming conventions can be skipped ONLY for pure backend projects (APIs, CLI, workers) without any UI layer
- All examples MUST match the project's programming languages and frameworks
- Standards MUST be consistent with architecture decisions
- Ground-rules constraints MUST be respected
- ERROR if UI naming conventions section is incomplete or missing for frontend/UI projects
- If backend-only project (no UI), document "N/A" for UI naming section and proceed
- Reference architecture.md for technology stack context
- Research best practices specific to the project's tech stack
- Provide concrete examples for every convention

## Research Guidelines

When researching naming conventions and standards:

1. **For UI frameworks**:
   - Research: "{framework} component naming conventions best practices"
   - Research: "{framework} file structure best practices"
   - Examples: "React component naming conventions", "Vue composable naming"

2. **For backend languages**:
   - Research: "{language} naming conventions PEP8/style guide"
   - Research: "{language} project structure best practices"
   - Examples: "Python PEP 8 naming conventions", "Java naming conventions Oracle"

3. **For databases**:
   - Research: "{database} naming conventions best practices"
   - Examples: "PostgreSQL table naming conventions", "MongoDB collection naming"

4. **For APIs**:
   - Research: "RESTful API naming conventions best practices"
   - Research: "GraphQL schema naming conventions"
   - Research: "API versioning strategies"

5. **For design systems**:
   - Research: "{design system} naming conventions"
   - Examples: "Material Design naming conventions", "Bootstrap class naming"

## UI Naming Convention Requirements (For Frontend/UI Projects)

## Example Usage

```bash
# Generate standards for the entire product
/rainbow.standardize

# Generate standards with specific focus
/rainbow.standardize Focus on React component naming and TypeScript conventions

# Generate standards for specific domain
/rainbow.standardize Healthcare application with HIPAA compliance considerations
```

## Notes

- This command creates **product-level standards**, not feature-level standards
- Run this AFTER ground-rules, rainbow, and architect commands
- Run this BEFORE creating feature implementation plans (`/rainbow.design`)
- The standards guide ALL development work across ALL features
- Update the standards document as the project evolves
- UI naming conventions are non-negotiable and must be thorough
- Standards should be enforced through automated tools (linters, formatters)
- Consider creating a style guide website for easy team reference
- Regularly review and update standards based on team feedback
